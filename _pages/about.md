Chemist by training and a "maker" by heart. Currently based at Wageningen University & Research (WUR), my work lives at the intersection of organic chemistry, material science, and DIY technology.

My mission is the democratization of science. I believe that the high cost and the closeness of scientific instrumentation should not be a barrier to discovery. To solve this, I develop "Open Technologies": repurposing consumer electronics like 3D printers and microcontrollers into sophisticated laboratory robots and diagnostic tools. From the T-Cup (a low-cost, non-instrumental DNA detection device) to the EnderScope (an automated scanning microscope built on a 3D printer frame), my research proves that cutting-edge science can be affordable, open, transparent, and reproducible.

Beyond the lab, I am a passionate educator and advocate for Open Science. Whether I am teaching molecular life science students how to code Arduinos for "Experiments@Home" or demonstrating the ancient nanotech of the Lycurgus Cup, sometimes at MakerFaires, I strive to inspire a new generation of scientists to move away from "black-box" instruments and toward a creative, hands-on understanding of the tools they use.

*Let’s Collaborate*
I am a firm believer that the most impactful science happens at the intersection of disciplines. I am always looking for partners: academic, industrial, or citizen scientists, who share a passion for Open Innovation. Whether you are looking to co-develop low-cost lab automation, require custom 3D microfluidic architectures, or are interested in testing our sustainable bio-resins, my lab is open for collaboration. I am particularly interested in projects that aim to democratize scientific tools for use in low-resource settings.

*The Team*
This is a personal website, however behind every "Lab Hack" and every publication is a dedicated team of brilliant minds. My research is the result of deep collaboration, and I am immensely grateful to my current and former PhD students. Their creativity, persistence, and willingness to "fail forward" are what turn open-source ideas into scientific reality. They are the true makers in the lab.
Many thanks to my colleagues at the Department of BioNanoTechnology (WUR). Being part of such a multidisciplinary and supportive environment provides the perfect ecosystem for exploring the intersection of chemistry and technology. The innovations featured on this personal website, from 3D-printed microfluidics to sustainable resins, are a testament to the collective expertise and shared vision of our department.
